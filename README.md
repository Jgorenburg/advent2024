## Advent Of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge which presents 25 problems from December 1st to Christmas. I completed every challenge in 2024 within the first 24 hours after their release. The code and input data for each problem, as well as my thoughts on many of them can be found in `advent2024/main/src`.
