Challenge 13:

Part 1

Thoughts: Could've solved this using linear equations, but since the problem had a 100 presses limit I decided to brute force it

Part 2

Thoughts: As expected, part two requires more math knowledge. I'm not a fan of this since it requires background outside coding, which doesn't feel right. Anyone with a decent math background can solve this easily and those without are going to struggle
