Challenge 14:

Part 1

Thoughts: An interesting but ultimately simple puzzle. I'm sure there's a simpler way to deal with the teleporting, but I like my solution too much to search for it

Part 2

Thoughts: God that was frustrating. Why would the christmas tree only take a small portion of the screen? Why not show what it's supposed to look like? Without the reddit I never would've known what to look for since I assumed every robot would be used in the tree. I know I was harsh on yesterday's challenge, but that was excusable, this isn't
