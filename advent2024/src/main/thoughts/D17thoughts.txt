Part 2

Thoughts: Now that was a challenge! I initially tried to brute force it, but that's really difficult to do using worksheets. Eventually I reverse engineered the operations for each step and wrote a program to figure out what values of A could give the next value of A and the correct output. This sort of backsolving only worked because B and C were overwritten by A between each output
