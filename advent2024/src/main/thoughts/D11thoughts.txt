Challenge 11:

Part 1

Thoughts: Fairly simple problem because of the low depth. I wrote a brute-force solution in a short amount of time

Cleverness - 1/5
Cleanliness - 4/5
Efficiency - 1/5


Part 2

Thoughts: First puzzle where efficiency mattered. I went through a couple ideas before I found one I liked. Had some trouble coding my first few ideas before I threw them out, but my final plan wasn't difficult to implement

Personal Ratings:
Cleverness - 3/5
Cleanliness - 4/5
Efficiency - 4/5  I'd have loved to be able to skip transform levels for values we'd previously encountered, but it proved unecessary for a depth of 75
